# NativeLife

NativeLife is simply a travel application for Android users. 

**Problem**
When traveling to foreign countries there is no single resource that aids travelers in learning about the cultural and technological norms, customs, or activities and foods that are known only by a few outside of the locals -- places that allow millennial travelers to truly immerse themselves in the life of the country.

As such, the goal of this app is to provide travelers with information that will allow them to have an enhanced travel experience. 

**Our Solution**
With this app, users will able to access crowdsourced database and easily view and filter suggestions for any location of interest according to several main categories of concern when traveling to a foreign country. Users can filter by any of 6 categories and create posts (assuming they are within range of the location) which will give them access to photos, descriptions, and locations of the various stories posted on our app. Everything in our app is aimed to display information in a more aesthetic and digestable format (photo grid). In addition, users will only be able to post their story if they are within a certain distance of the location they are posting about, which, we hope, makes it more likely for natives to post than tourists going to typical attractions and is what differentiates us from other travel apps.  User can also add a location if it cannot be found in our database.

This is all made possible through the use of Firebase (Authentication, Realtime Database, and Cloud Storage), recycler grids and views, and other Android Studio functions.

It is our hope that in having this resource, travelers can have a more enriching travel experience compared to the typical tourist.
